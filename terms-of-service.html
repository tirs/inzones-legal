    <h1>Terms of Use (EULA)</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, or using Inzones ("the App"), you agree to be
      bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms"), also referred to as the End-User
      License Agreement (EULA). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the
      App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The App is an offline-first gardening tool that provides:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>USDA plant hardiness zone lookup by zip code</li>
      <li>Estimated frost dates based on historical weather data</li>
      <li>Personalized planting schedules for vegetables, herbs, and fruits</li>
      <li>Growing information and recommendations for 113 plants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All plant data and core functionality is available offline without
      requiring an internet connection. An internet connection is required only
      for purchasing or restoring subscriptions.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Free and Paid Tiers</h2>
    <p>The App offers a free tier and a paid "Pro" tier:</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Free:</strong> Search any zone, browse all plants, see what to
      plant today. Data is not saved between sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pro (paid subscription):</strong> Save your zone, persistent home
      screen with your data, saved preferences between sessions. Available as
      Monthly, Annual, or Lifetime plans.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Subscription Terms</h2>
    <p>
      Subscriptions are billed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
      By subscribing, you agree to the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment is charged to your Apple ID or Google account at confirmation of purchase</li>
      <li>Monthly and Annual subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period</li>
      <li>You can manage or cancel your subscription at any time through your device's app store settings</li>
      <li>Lifetime purchases are a one-time payment and do not renew</li>
      <li>No refunds are provided for partial billing periods; refund requests must be directed to Apple or Google per their respective refund policies</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Prices are set in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store and may vary
      by region. We reserve the right to change subscription pricing; existing
      subscribers will be notified before any price change takes effect on their
      next renewal.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Informational Use Only</h2>
    <p>
      The information provided by the App is for general informational and
      educational purposes only. Planting dates, frost dates, zone
      classifications, and growing recommendations are estimates based on
      historical data and may not reflect actual conditions in your specific
      location.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that gardening outcomes depend on many factors beyond the
      scope of this App, including but not limited to local microclimate, soil
      conditions, weather patterns, and gardening practices. The App does not
      guarantee any particular gardening results.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any
      kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
      non-infringement.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not warrant that the information in the App is accurate, complete,
      or current, or that the App will be uninterrupted or error-free.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the
      developers of Inzones be liable for any indirect, incidental, special,
      consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues,
      whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use,
      goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your use of or inability to use the App</li>
      <li>Any inaccuracy in the data or recommendations provided</li>
      <li>Any damage to your plants, garden, or property based on information from the App</li>
      <li>Any unauthorized access to or alteration of your device data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Data Sources</h2>
    <p>The App uses data derived from publicly available sources including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map</li>
      <li>NOAA historical weather and frost date records</li>
      <li>University extension service publications</li>
      <li>Public agricultural reference materials</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These data sources are used under fair use for educational and
      informational purposes. The App is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or
      sponsored by the USDA, NOAA, or any university extension service.
    </p>

    <h2>9. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>
      You agree not to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise
      attempt to derive the source code of the App, except to the extent that
      such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The App, including its design, code, graphics, icons, and content, is
      protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not
      copy, modify, distribute, or create derivative works based on the App
      without prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be
      effective when the updated App is published. Your continued use of the App
      after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Because the App supports account creation (sign-in with Apple or Google),
      we provide an option to initiate account deletion so you have control
      over the data you have shared while using the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete your account and all app data from this device: open the App,
      go to Settings, then under the Account section tap "Delete Account."
      After confirmation, the App will remove from this device your stored
      sign-in profile, saved zone, garden plan, and subscription status cache,
      and you will be signed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting your account in the App does not delete your Apple ID or Google
      account. To manage or delete your Apple identity, visit appleid.apple.com.
      To manage or delete your Google account data, visit myaccount.google.com.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your
      device. Upon uninstallation, all locally stored data will be removed.
      Active subscriptions must be canceled separately through your device's app
      store settings; uninstalling the App does not automatically cancel a
      subscription.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws
      of the jurisdiction in which the developer resides, without regard to
      conflict of law principles.
    </p>
