    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 18, 2026</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Inzones ("the App") is a mobile application that provides USDA hardiness
      zone information and personalized planting dates for vegetables, herbs,
      and fruits. The App offers both free and paid subscription tiers. Your
      privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information
      the App collects, how it is used, and your rights regarding that
      information.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not directly collect, transmit to our servers, or share any of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
      <li>Location data (GPS coordinates, IP address)</li>
      <li>Device identifiers or advertising IDs</li>
      <li>Usage analytics or behavioral data</li>
      <li>Cookies or tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      The App stores a small amount of data locally on your device using
      on-device storage (AsyncStorage). This data never leaves your device and
      includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your saved USDA hardiness zone (if you choose to save it)</li>
      <li>Your garden planting plan (if you are signed in and have added plants)</li>
      <li>App preferences</li>
      <li>Subscription status (active plan type and expiration)</li>
      <li>If you sign in: your display name, email (if provided), and provider (Apple or Google) for account identification only</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can clear your saved zone using the "Clear" button in Settings. To
      delete all app data associated with your account, including sign-in and
      subscription cache, use "Delete Account" in Settings under Account when
      signed in. Uninstalling the App also removes all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>Account Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Because the App supports account creation (sign-in with Apple or Google),
      we also provide an option to initiate account deletion so you have
      control over the data you have shared while using the App.
    </p>
    <p>
      To delete your account and all app data from this device: open the App,
      go to Settings, then under the Account section tap "Delete Account."
      After you confirm, we remove from this device your stored sign-in profile,
      saved zone, garden plan, and subscription status cache. You will be signed
      out. Account deletion is permanent for this device and cannot be undone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deleting your account in the App does not delete your Apple ID or Google
      account. To manage or delete your Apple identity, visit
      appleid.apple.com. To manage or delete your Google account data, visit
      myaccount.google.com.
    </p>

    <h2>Offline Operation</h2>
    <p>
      All plant data, zone data, frost date information, and planting
      recommendations are embedded within the App itself. No internet connection
      is required to browse plants or look up your zone.
    </p>
    <p>
      An internet connection is required only when purchasing or restoring a
      subscription. These transactions are processed entirely by Apple (App
      Store) or Google (Google Play) and are subject to their respective privacy
      policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers optional paid subscriptions (Monthly, Annual, and
      Lifetime). All payment processing is handled by Apple or Google through
      their respective app stores. We do not receive, store, or have access to
      your payment card details, billing address, or other financial
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apple and Google may share limited transaction data with us (such as
      whether a subscription is active and its expiration date) for the purpose
      of granting access to paid features. We do not use this data for any other
      purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or
      tracking services. The only third-party interaction is with Apple App
      Store or Google Play Store for processing subscription purchases. These
      services are governed by their own privacy policies:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Apple: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" class="contact-email">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</a></li>
      <li>Google: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" class="contact-email">https://policies.google.com/privacy</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      The App does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
      children under the age of 13. Subscription purchases require an Apple ID
      or Google account, which are subject to the age requirements of those
      platforms. The App content is safe for users of all ages.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All user data remains on your device under the security protections
      provided by your operating system. Subscription payment data is protected
      by Apple and Google's payment infrastructure and is never accessible to
      us.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected in the App with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of
      the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
    </p>
